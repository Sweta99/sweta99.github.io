<p>Hello, As you can see my name is Sweta. Currently I am a seventeen year old student at University at Buffalo. I am a freshman and my major is Computer Science.I am an international student at UB. Originally I come from Bangladesh, it is my birth country and where I have lived for the first sixteen years of my life. I then went to high-school in Canada.  </p>

<h2>
<a id="computer-science" class="anchor" href="#computer-science" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Computer Science</h2>

<p>I got interested in computer science for the first time when I got my first smart phone. I kept thinking how ingenious it was, everything at was at the tip of my hands and all i needed was a swipe of my fingers to activate it. Later on in high-school i would become more invested as my Uncle, who was in Canada at the time, is a programmer. So far I like what I have been taught in class and look forward to more.</p>
