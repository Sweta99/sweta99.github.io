  "body": "# Introduction\r\nHello, As you can see my name is Sweta. Currently I am a seventeen year old student at University at Buffalo. I am a freshman and my major is Computer Science.I am an international student at UB. Originally I come from Bangladesh, it is my birth country and where I have lived for the first sixteen years of my life. I then went to high-school in Canada.  \r\n\r\n## Computer Science\r\nI got interested in computer science for the first time when I got my first smart phone. I kept thinking how ingenious it was, everything at was at the tip of my hands and all i needed was a swipe of my fingers to activate it. Later on in high-school i would become more invested as my Uncle, who was in Canada at the time, is a programmer. So far I like what I have been taught in class and look forward to more.\r\n\r\n",
